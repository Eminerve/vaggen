        <p>Väggen offers to artists the way to have a free expression wall and more, an exhibition wall around Stockholm valuing by that, the district, the graffiti, and the Street Art.</p>
        <p>Väggen will be divided in three sections to diversify the artistic approaches:
          <ul>
            <li>•	<strong>The daily</strong> wall where you can test, do quick pieces, and be initiated to graffiti.</li><br>
            <li>•	<strong>The weekly</strong> wall which will used by artists who want to take their time to work on their composition.</li><br>
            <li>•	<strong>The monthly</strong> wall is an open-air gallery which invites one artist per month and offers to him to be discovered during this period.</li>
          </ul>
